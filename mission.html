          <p>We strive to create measurable and lasting social change by developing inclusive cultural heritage experiences that give voice to unheard narratives and perspectives. We help communities tell and amplify their own stories, so that incomplete dominant narratives do not persist. We are focused on inclusive narrative and historical representation in order to support social, cultural and resource equity.</p>
          <h2>MISSION</h2>
          <p>We support and design community-driven initiatives to increase/boost social, cultural and resource equity. [FLAG: DEFICIT MODEL]</p>
          <h2>VALUES</h2>
          <p>[[Shift Design]] is committed to core values of equity, compassion and transparency. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Equity: We believe in a deep level of community involvement to solve problems of inequity. We challenge and engage cultural heritage organizations and leaders in particular, to create equitable, less extractive relationships with their communities. </li>
            <li>Compassion: We believe it is essential to bring an ethic of care and compassion into professional settings, into our work. We use human-centered approaches to research and design. We think about the humans behind the data. We believe in treating people with empathy, consideration, and respect, and in being present and listening. We also promote self-care. When you take care of yourself, you can take better care of other people.</li>
            <li>Transparency: We believe in being clear about our intentions, about why we make decisions. We strive to be change agents. We facilitate and support collaborative initiatives to bring about a shift from a culture of institutionalized power and marginalization to a culture of equity and inclusiveness. We seek systemic change, and we strive to achieve this [social change] with openness and clarity. </li>
