  <h2>How We Work</h2>
  <div class="row mb-4">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <p>We're a non-profit organization that designs programs and products to help solve social problems.<br>
        Mostly, we work at the intersection of cultural heritage and social justice.<br>
        We believe that cultural heritage institutions are well positioned to be at the forefront of fostering social
        change in [their] local communities. We help organizations both look internally at issues of diversity, inclusion, power and equity,
        while at the same time find their role in communities at the front lines of social justice, community development, and cultural preservation.
        We are at a critical juncture in which these organizations have the opportunity to support social change, and empower local
        communities in both time-tested and new ways. <br>
        We help cultural heritage organizations apply community-driven design practices to projects and programs for social
        change [to reach social equity goals]. We help make your organization more inclusive, representative, and relevant.<br>
        Our model for building community as a means for solving social problems works by putting the community at the center of all phases
        of program and product design. We work within a reproducible, transferable framework for achieving social equity [in narrative,
        culture and resources]. Using our proven tools and methodology, we bring the results cultural sector leaders need. Together we
        build the capacity of the heritage sector to effect change.<br>
